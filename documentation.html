				<h2> Introduction </h2>
				<p> This application is dedicated to the revealing of the noise levels, on your Pebble’s accelerometer. If you are new to this area of research, you may have not come across the word “noise” being used in this context before. In a broader sense of the word, it means a reduction in clarity. With acoustic noise, this is when someone makes and unwanted sound. The noise I am talking about is the "random and persistent disturbance, that obscures or reduces the clarity of a signal or measurement".
				</p>
				<h2> How it works </h2>
				<p>
				Now to the inner workings. This app measures the accelerometer 25 times and then produces results based on these 25 measurements. This value can be changed in the source code on line 13, if you are interested in a wider range of values. Once collected, all results are entered into arrays concerning their respective axis, x, y and z. The min, max and average values for each axis are then taken from these arrays.</p>
				<p>
				Noise is calculated via Max - Min in an absolute form, to avoid any misleading subtraction to do with negative numbers. Each value is outputted to an end screen you can see in the app, or keep track of in the console.
				</p>
				<h2>Known Bugs and Future Improvements</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Multiple instances upon returning to the main app screen. This has been temporarily fixed via a forced restart after a measurement has been analysed. </li>
					<li>Span of data could be improved by using the whole array which is being generated on each data event. </li>
				</ul>

				<h2> Introduction </h2>
				<p>While I realise there are many applications, for the pebble, that do present this data already, I have decided to make my own. This was due to the fact that, as well as for my own programming benefit, I could not find a simple monitoring application. Also, most are written in C, so I felt a JavaScript version was needed.  
				</p>
				<h2> How it works </h2>
				<p> Using pebble.js, once select is pressed, I look for a "Accel.on('data', callback)". These fire continuously, until back or select is pressed. Upon this event, I unsubscribe from the data event and return to the main screen. 
				</p>
				<h2>Known Bugs and Future Improvements</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Problems switching to and from the tracking screen and the main screen, can result in a crash or the app being forced back to the tracking screen.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2> Introduction </h2>
				<p>The initial application produced to provide me with an accelerometer read out. While it does not monitor the accelerometer in real time, upon on the press on the “select” button (the middle button on the watch), it then outputs accelerometer data to do the screen. The back button can then be pressed to get back to the main screen. Once here, another measurement can be taken and so on. </p>

				<p>This application also was my first introduction into the Graphical User Interface behind the pebble. Admittedly, in my limited experience in application development, I don’t really know the correct way in which to develop a GUI for an application. On the other hand, I felt like the way the Pebble goes about it, is unconventional. This is due to the use of “windows” and “cards” to control the screens with methods to hide and show them, rather than close and open. Nevertheless, it seems to work well and was easy to pick up, but I do foresee problems in future development, with many menus producing many instances of windows stacked on top of each other. </p>
				
				<h2> How it works </h2>
				<p>This being my first proper application using pebble.js is very crude in the way it works. However, it was a learning curve into the documentation and various applications for the accelerometer. 
				The app works by retrieving the first sample of the array produced on the data event at the time of the click of the select button. Being relatively simple, it only takes up 54 lines of code, including spaces. Many console logs also allow for tracking in the console output.
