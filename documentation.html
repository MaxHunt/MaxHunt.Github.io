				<h2> Introduction </h2>
				<p> This application is dedicated to the revealing of the noise levels, on your Pebble’s accelerometer. If you are new to this area of research, you may have not come across the word “noise” being used in this context before. In a broader sense of the word, it means a reduction in clarity. With acoustic noise, this is when someone makes and unwanted sound. The noise I am talking about is the "random and persistent disturbance, that obscures or reduces the clarity of a signal or measurement".
				</p>
				<h2> How it works </h2>
				<p>
				Now to the inner workings. This app measures the accelerometer 25 times and then produces results based on these 25 measurements. This value can be changed in the source code on line 13, if you are interested in a wider range of values. Once collected, all results are entered into arrays concerning their respective axis, x, y and z. The min, max and average values for each axis are then taken from these arrays.</p>
				<p>
				Noise is calculated via Max - Min in an absolute form, to avoid any misleading subtraction to do with negative numbers. Each value is outputted to an end screen you can see in the app, or keep track of in the console.
				</p>
				<h2>Known Bugs and Future Improvements</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Multiple instances upon returning to the main app screen. This has been temporarily fixed via a forced restart after a measurement has been analysed. </li>
					<li>Span of data could be improved by using the whole array which is being generated on each data event. </li>
				</ul>

				<h2> Introduction </h2>
				<p>While I realise there are many applications, for the pebble, that do this already, I have decided to mkae my own. This was due to the fact that, as well as for my own progamming benifit, I could not find a simple monitoriting application. Also, most are written in C where as I feel a javascript verison is well nedded. 
				</p>
				<h2> How it works </h2>
				<p> Using pebble.js, once select is pressed, I look for a "Accel.on('data', callback)". These fire continuosly unitl back or select is pressed. Upon this event, I unsubscribe from the data event and return to the main screen.
				</p>
				<h2>Known Bugs and Future Improvements</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Problems switching to and from the tracking screen and the main screen can result in a crash or forceing the app back to the tracking screen.</li>
